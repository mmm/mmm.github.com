<hr />
<p>Physicist turned Software Developer, Data Scientist, then Devops Engineer.</p>
<p>In love with data driven decision making and data engineering… at any scale.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>I’m a Data Plumber. I spend most days designing/tuning/fixing/banging-on data pipelines and the infrastructure behind data-intensive applications of all sorts.</p>
<p>Originally trained as a Physicist (Ph.D. researching how quantum computers can learn to tolerate noise and errors), I’ve since had an incredible career out in the world where Data Science meets DevOps and infrastructure engineering.</p>
<p>I’ve been lucky enough to work for companies like Canonical, the folks behind the Ubuntu operating system, Infochimps, DigitalOcean, and now Google. Places where talented teams of people are innovating and leading open-source communities and the tech industry as a whole.</p>
<h2 id="current-passions">Current Passions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>training data scientists. I teach an online class that’s essentially “Just enough data engineering” for data scientists in Berkeley’s Data Science Masters (MIDS) Program</p></li>
<li><p>adopting test-driven methodologies into building data pipelines… keeping pipelines strongly connected to the actual problems that need to be solved</p></li>
<li><p>and then pretty much anything to do with AI in infrastructure automation :-)</p></li>

<p>Dissertation: “Dynamical Stability of Quantum Algorithms.” Supervisor: E.C.G. Sudarshan Created a numerical model to characterize noise in Grover’s quantum search algorithm. This model was then used to determine the maximum amount of noise that the bare algorithm can tolerate before failing. This is useful in determining exactly which emerging technologies will prove to be viable for implementing quantum computers. Technology Used: C++, Perl, BASH script, LaTeX, numerical solutions to ODEs, randomization, various matrix calculations (using blitz++, TNT, and LAPACK).</p>
