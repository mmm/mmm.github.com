We're doing a series of regular CharmSchools on G+ hangouts.

Watch the video from last week 
[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRcqSjOGweo)
where we did an intro to juju and charming.

There're links to the whole series of charmschool hangouts in the juju
[video archive](https://juju.ubuntu.com/resources/videos/)
where we also have videos and screencasts of demos, talks,  and any other charm
schools we've been able to capture on video.
