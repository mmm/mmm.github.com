Continuing the series of regular CharmSchool Hangouts.

[Last week](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRcqSjOGweo)
we wrote a charm from scratch.

Starting from a simple node.js application, we put together "just enough" charm
to get things working.  Watch for future episodes where we'll refactor and
refine both the application and the charm.

As before, there are links to the whole series of charmschool hangouts in the juju
[video archive](https://juju.ubuntu.com/resources/videos/)
where we also have videos and screencasts of demos, talks,  and any other charm
schools we've been able to capture on video.
