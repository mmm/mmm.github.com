I Put together a series of demo videos using juju-0.7 for oscon.

These are really interesting in that they involve migrating environments
between providers.  This works slightly differently on the newer juju-1.x
series, but the idea's still sound.

There's no sound on these... they're raw video backups for demoing juju (in
case we lost networking during the demo).
