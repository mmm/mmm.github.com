What do you think of when you hear the word 'infrastructure'?

Do you think about
power/cooling
servers
application frameworks


reference zed shaw and that other dude on launchpad -vs- github

dev -vs- ops

Incidentally, thinking about services, not machines
is what makes ensemble special.  It's precisely these
relations that enable this level of abstraction to
actually work.
