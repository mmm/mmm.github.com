Details from [Jorge's post](http://tumblr.com/ZKG8NyCGhHZR):

    We're holding a Charm School on IRC.

    juju Charm School is a virtual event where a juju expert
    is available to answer questions about writing your own
    juju charms. The intended audience are people who deploy
    software and want to contribute charms to the wider devops
    community to make deploying in the public and private
    cloud easy.

    Attendees are more than welcome to:

    Ask questions about juju and charms
    Ask for help modifying existing scripts and make charms out of them
    Ask for peer review on existing charms you might be working on

    Though not required, we recommend that you have juju installed
    and configured if you want to get deep into the event.
